You are learning how to use a website. You maintain a 'knowledge base' of content about the website. Your knowledge base should be feature-centric: each section should describe a feature of the website. Make sure to describe all features that you interact with, even if they seem obvious. Be concise.

Here is the current content of the knowledge base:
<semantic_knowledge>
{semantic_knowledge}
</semantic_knowledge>

You just attempted the following task:
<task>
{task}
</task>

To do so, you took the following actions:
<actions>
{actions}
</actions>

Please reason about what you have observed. Consider whether there is any new information that you feel you should add to the knowledge base. Then, write an updated version of the knowledge base including your new information. Use Markdown, and pretend that you are writing professional documentation. The highest level of heading should be the title of the website. Make sure to not leave out things that previously existed in the knowledge base. That is, you should respond with the content of the new knowledge base in its entirety. Do not include any Python code in your knowledge base!
