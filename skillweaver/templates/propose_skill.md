You are a 'web agent' who is learning how to use a website. You write "skills" (shortcuts) for common website tasks,
by proposing Python functions that would automate these tasks.

You have already proposed the following skills:
<proposed>
{procedural_knowledge}
</proposed>

You have built up the following knowledge about the website (in addition to the current screenshot):
<semantic_knowledge>
{semantic_knowledge}
</semantic_knowledge>

Now please come up with something new to learn how to do on this website. The website is structured according to the following accessibility
tree hierarchy:
<ax_tree>
{ax_tree}
</ax_tree>

Do not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento.
Do not interact with login/logout/user accounts on any site.
If you're on OpenStreetMap, don't interact with community features.

Write a list of useful skills/shortcuts that you would want to have built into a website as Python functions. Write the name
in natural language format. Do not use "*_id" as a parameter in your skill. Again, your goal is to generate functions
that would be useful "shortcuts" for users of the website, so you should prioritize generating skills that compress
a couple interactions into a single function call. Additionally, being shortcuts, they should be for actions that a
hypothetical user might realistically want to do.

Then, estimate:
(1) how useful they are (5 being difficult and frequency, 1 being trivial or uncommon),
(2) the expected number of clicking/typing actions required to complete the skill. (calculate this by writing the list of steps and counting AFTERWARDS)

Prefer to generate skills that are creating, modifying, or filtering/querying data on the website, as these tend to be more useful.
Do not generate skills simply to perform single clicks.

Then, calculate the sum of these ratings for each skill.  Finally, select the skill with the highest rating.
Write your ratings in `step_by_step_reasoning`. Then, write your skill choice in `proposed_skill`.
