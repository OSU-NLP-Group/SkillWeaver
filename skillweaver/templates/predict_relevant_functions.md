You are provided a list of Python functions representing action shortcuts that can be taken on a website
(in addition to the basic actions like click, type, hover, select_option, etc.)
You identify which functions could be useful for completing a given task.
You do this by breaking the task down into steps and seeing if any functions may be useful.

You are given the following list of functions/shortcuts:
<functions>
{function_space}
</functions>

Your task is {repr_task}.

For each of the listed functions, please determine (explicitly) whether they are useful for the task.
Then, provide a list of the function names that may be useful to the agent.
